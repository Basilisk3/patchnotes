                            <p>Welcome to the patchnotes for the 3678 beta patch.</p>
                            <p>Included in this beta patch are factory HP changes(yes, again), a sera second gun buff, a janus nerf, reduced wreck reclaim rate, reduced healing from vet for experimentals</p>
                            <p>Try out the new features and changes and leave your feedback and replays on the balance forum. Thank you.</p>

                            <h3><img src="images/Reclaim_icon.png"> Reclaim</h3>
                            <p>There have been some changes discussed for a long time in the community and one of them is decreasing the speed of reclaiming. A T1 engy can reclaim 50 mass/s which is a very high rate. This makes reclaim fields disappear very quickly after being deposited. We have decided to reduce the reclaim rate by half for wrecks to allow reclaim fields to be more contestable to improve the dynamic map control element created by reclaim fields.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Reclaim time of unit wrecks has been doubled. Props and live units are unaffected.</li>
                            </ul>
								
                            <h3><img src="images/t2engie.png"> Tree groups</h3>
                            <p>We found microing engineers to reclaim treegroups without breaking them to be a quite intensive and annoying task with no real benefit. Engineers no longer split treegroups when walking on them so you don't have to micro them so much to be efficient. Split treegroups also get +5% reclaim value to balance it against the inefficiency of reclaiming each tree individually.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Engineers no longer split tree groups.</li>
								<li>The mass and energy value of split trees has been increased by 5%. to balance them against the inefficiency.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3><img src="images/seracom.png">Refracting Chronotron Amplifier</h3>
							<p>The Seraphim second gun is one of the rarest upgrades, many players have never even seen it used in a game. We are buffing it with increased damage and AoE, while increasing the mass cost and decreasing the energy cost to keep it as a very powerful lategame option for an aggressive acu and even telesniping.</p>
							<ul>
                                <li>Mass cost: <strike>3500</strike> → 4800</li>
								<li>Energy cost: <strike>300000</strike> → 270000</li>
								<li>AOE: <strike>2</strike> → 2.7</li>
								<li>Additional damage: <strike>400</strike> → 750</li>
                            </ul>
							
							<h3><img src="images/Janus.png">Janus</h3>
							<p>The small buff to janus in the last patch raised some eyebrows. A very stupid miscalculation was made by me(Jagged) which is now fixed, so janus will no longer be so powerful. Apologies for this poor oversight and weak testing. There was also a very abusable bug which has been found and now fixed.<p>
							<ul>
								<li>DoT Pulses: <strike>15</strike> → 10</li>
								<li>Fixed a bug that made cluster bombs gain a new target halfway through a run.</li>
							</ul>
							
							<h3><img src="images/monkeylord.png">Veterancy</h3>
							<p>Instant healing from vet has always been a somewhat controversial feature, especially in the case of experimentals when they are in the later stages of veterancy. We have reduced the instant healing from vet for XPs by 50% but left the max health gained unchanged.<p>
							<ul>
								<li>Reduced the amount of instantly gained HP for experimental units by 50%.</li>

                            <h3>Factory HPs</h3>
                            <p>Factory HPs are being overhauled to some degree once again, and hopefully for the last time in the near future. Naval factory HPs are the main focus here. Given that navy is a more expensive and generally powerful arena than land or air on a given tech level, it has had some of its hp restored. HP values have also been realigned to make them very easy to learn should you feel the need to, to make predicting the number of units needed to snipe a factory much easier.</p>
