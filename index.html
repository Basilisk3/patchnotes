			<h1>Patch 3644</h1>
			<p>Welcome to the patchnotes for 3643. It's been a while since the last balance patch, but after the restructuring of FAF and the establishment of the new council of setons, a balance team is now finally in place. We wanted to release a patch that solves the biggest and most widely accepted problems as fast as possible to make sure you can already have more fun with the game while we are working on the next changes. Some of the problems are a fairly complex, and to completely solve them without delaying the patch or creating new problems was not possible, but we put some changes in place that should tone them down until we can solve them for good.

			<p>In addition we fixed a few of the more difficult remaining bugs and added a new feature that we hope everyone will like: The death damage of experimentals is now becoming much more realistic and interesting. (cut if we don't do that this patch)

			<p>We worked hard to improve your gaming experience with FA and hope you'll enjoy playing with the new patch even more than before. Feedback, bugs or suggestions are greatly appreciated in the balance or tech support (for technical bugs) sections of the forum.

			<p>Thanks to the testing team, the coding team and everyone else who helped testing or made suggestions and ideas in the forums.

			<p>-- Foley, Nombringer, Nyx, pip, Sheeo, Vee, ZLO, Zock</p>

			<h3><img src="images/acutml.png"> ACU TML (UEF and Seraphim) / Seraphim SCU TML</h3>
			Not much needs to be said much about the ACU TML and it's negative impact on teamgames. We are removing some of the reasons that made it so superior to normal TML launchers against TMDs. Making the upgrade count should now require a much smarter use of it's advantages now instead of getting an immensely powerful weapon for little investment.
			<ul>
			<li>Missle hitpoints: <strike>3 hp</strike> → 2 hp
			<li>Flying height: now similar to normal TML
			<li>Missile build time with t2 acu: <strike>7 seconds</strike> → 20 seconds
			</ul>
			
			Only for Seraphim:
			
			<ul>
				<li>Area of effect: <strike>3</strike> → 2
				<li>The flying arc at close range will now be similar to the UEF ACU TML
			</ul>

		<div class="card">
			<h3><img src="images/cybrantml.png"> Cybran TML</h3>
			We wanted to keep Cybrans advantage of killing targets next to TMDs with several missiles, which is a compensation for their weak defence. However, this should not allow the Cybran player to easily take out the TMD itself with the unit that they are supposed to counter. With this change, a single missile is not enough to kill a TMD anymore. This means that sooner or later you will still need two of them to be completely safe, but you will have more time to get them (or repair the damaged one after a failed attempt to kill it), and it will take double the effort and resources to take the ones out you have.
			
			<ul>			
			<li>All TMDs will now survive a single cybran tactical missile
			</ul>

			<h3>SCUs</h3>
			We are trying to fix the hitbox issues that made the SCUs much stronger than they should be, while also fine-tuning some of stats for the upgrades. Then, we areWe are also making them more difficult to micro by reducing their turnrate to the value of an ACU.
Another advantage they had over normal units was the lack of reclaim you would get for destroying them inside your territory. They will now leave wreckage like other units. Be careful though; Multiple SCUs might just reclaim the leftovers of their comrades, but at least they can't shoot while doing so, giving you time to destroy them before they steal your mass or get a second line of defence up. It will also become easier to make RAS SCUs without having to make unnecessary clicks; RAS presets have now been added.

			<ul>			
			<li>Hitbox: lasers can now hit SCUs more reliably
			<li>Turn rate: <strike>150</strike> → 90
			<li>Turret turn rate: <strike>180</strike> → 90 
			<li>SCUs now leave a normal wreckage of 81% when destroyed
			<li>A RAS preset for UEF, Cybran and Aeon is now available for production from the Quantum Gateways.

			<h3>Hover tanks</h3>
			The advantage of hoverunits is their great flexibility, enabling them to be used both on water and on land. However if they are so effective that even pure naval units have significant trouble with large amounts of hoverunits, something is wrong. Furthermore their fast speed makes it unreasonably tiresome to defend against them on raiding-vulnerable island maps. In addition to the hitbox fixes in 3641 we increased their buildtime as well as reducing their speed on water.

			<h3>Seraphim Tech 2 bot and Tech 3 Tank Changes</h3>
			We like the diversity that a strong t2 and a weak t3 stage brings to the game, but on some maps Seraphim is just a little bit too dominant on t2, while on others too helpless on t3. We are carefully toning down both areas while keeping the idea behind it intact.

		<a name="harb"></a>
		<div class="card">
			<h3><img src="images/harb.png"> Harbinger</h3>
			Harbingers are a complicated unit, while being immensely dominant in the early t3 stages, they already lose in bigger numbers to other t3 tanks. Straight out nerfing them would not only lower their early game advantage (and the very satisfying feeling of the unit) but also cause potential problems in the lategame. Increasing the buildtime to the same mass/BT ratio of Percivals and Bricks will make it harder to produce many Harbinger too early and will give the opponent more time to bring their own counters in place, but should not hurt Aeon too much later. The problems behind the power of the Harbinger lie deeper than this, but it will require more time to solve them. Until then, this change should make the life of non-aeons a little bit easier.

		<div class="card">
			<h3><img src="images/summit.png"> Summit</h3>
			Once your UEF opponent reaches the t3 stage, you are playing against a time-bomb. As UEF pays for this with a weak t2 navy, there is nothing wrong with this, except that this time-bomb is ticking a bit too fast. Making the main reason for the UEF dominance more expensive will give other factions more time to beat them before they are able to gather a critical mass of battleships that can use their range in combination with their great support units to dominate the sea.

		<div class="card">
			<h3><img src="images/uefstrat.png"> Strategic bombers</h3>
			Strat rushes can easily decide a game if the opponent is not t3 yet. This is a complex problem and a real solution would break the boundaries of this patch, but we acknowledge the issue and are trying to reduce it until a real solution is in place. We are increasing the energy cost to the same mass/energy ratio of ASFs, to avoid the ability to rush a strat without sufficient amounts of power (t3 PG or RAS).

		<a name="corsair"></a>
		<div class="card">
			<h3><img src="images/corsair.png"> Corsair</h3>
			In the last patch, Corsairs received a range decrease to prevent them from killing mobile flak too easily without getting shot. However, this also reduced the distance their projectile had to travel to reach the target, effectively making it harder to dodge. We are keeping the nerf against mobile flak, but reducing the speed of their projectiles to make them as easy (or hard) to dodge as they were before.

			<h3><img src="images/awhassa.png"> Awhassa</h3>
			Similar to the changes with the CZAR-Beam last patch, ASF can't be so easily destroyed anymore by abusing the splash of an anti-ground weapon with ground fire. Additionally, we are bringing the veterancy of the Ahwassa more in line with its power and the amount of units it can kill. We are also reducing the speed that made the unit even more powerful than it should be.
