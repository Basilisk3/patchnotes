            <p>
                The construction drones of the UEF faction are prime candidates for various tasks. Due to a bug they could be ignored as a target as anti air weapons scan for targets in their vicinity. As a result the drones are now a lot more vulnerable to anti air.

            <ul>
              <li>
                Rover drones (from the kennel) are no longer ignored as a target after docking once
              </li>
              <li>
                Shoulder drones (of the UEF ACU) are now ignored as a target by weapons when they are docked on the shoulders
              </li>

              There have been long standing problems with missile construction
              that have been confusing players for years. With thanks to an
              assembly patch we can tackle two of these problems.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                An adjacency bonus to structures building a missile is processed
                immediately
              </li>
              <li>
                The progress of the missile construction is restored when a unit
                changes army
