              The construction drones of the UEF faction are prime candidates
              for various tasks. Due to a bug they could be ignored as a target
              as anti air weapons scan for targets in their vicinity. As a
              result the drones are now a lot more vulnerable to anti air.

            <ul>
              <li>
                Rover drones (from the kennel) are no longer ignored as a target
                after docking once
              </li>
              <li>
                Shoulder drones (of the UEF ACU) are now ignored as a target by
                weapons when they are docked on the shoulders

              There have been long standing problems with missile construction
              that have been confusing players for years. With thanks to an
              assembly patch we can tackle two of these problems.

                The progress of the missile construction is restored when a unit

              The water ramp is a texture that helps a map author tweak the
              appearance of (deep) water. Up to now the water ramp was only
              applied to the terrain. Units would receive only the water surface
              color. We now have an approach to apply the water ramp to units,
              props and shields too. This improves the overall immersion where
              units now truly feel like they are underwater.

            <p>
              You can't reflect something that is occluded. Previously the water
              would still reflect the sun, regardless whether it was occluded.
              The change is subtle, but it adds a lot to the final image once
              you see it.

            <p>
              A common effect for water is that it refracts what is underwater.
              There was a bug in the shader code that would also reflect bits of
              units that are above water, creating an odd orange haze on the 
              water surface.
