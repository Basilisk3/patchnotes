            <h1>Patch 3688</h1>
            <p>Welcome to the patchnotes for the 3688 patch.</p>
            <p>This balance patch will be a small one. We basically just want to get all the fluffy stuff out of the way so we can focus on the t3 land rebalance in the upcoming patch.
            <br>We have also scrapped changes to the shield spillover and overcharge for now since we want to do them either after or with the next patch.
            <br>We hope you can appreciate the changes we made with this patch and welcome constructive feedback via the forum.</p>
            <p>We wish you good luck and much fun playing with the new patch!</p>

            <h3><img src="images/upgrade_icon.png"> Veterency</h3>
            <p>The veterency system is a thing that did bother us for a long time. Mostly because the amount of vet that each unit gives doesn't make a whole lot of sense - a spy plane gives the same amount of veterency points as a battleship for example.
            <br>We have allowed ourselves to take the system that is being used in Equilibrium. That means that the amount of veterency points will be determined by the mass value of each unit instead of "just" the tech level.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The mass value of the ACU has been reduced to 2 000 to avoid getting insane veterancy by killing an ACU</li>
              <li>The amount of veterency points that the ACU gains from higher tech units is reduced to avoid vetting too fast by overcharging mass heavy land units.</li>
              <li>Experimental units only need to kill 50% of their own worth in mass to gain one veterency rank.</li>
              <li>Regular units need to destroy 200% of their own worth in mass to gain one veterency rank.</li>
              <li>Destroying a transport gives veterancy points for the cargo as well as the transport itself.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3><img src="images/Cybran_T3_Gunship.png">Gunships</h3>
            <p>We have found that the seraphim gunship is fairly unimpressive so we scaled it up a decent bit. It is a bit stronger and can fight small amounts of mobile flak now which makes it somewhat unique.
            <br>The ability changes for the t3 gunships are motivated purely because we want different factions use different abilities. Since the UEF uses radar jamming for the most part and not cybran we decided to remove the jamming from the cybran gunship and give it to the uef gunship. To compensate for that the cybran gunship now has personal stealth.</p>

                  <li>Cybran T3 Gunships have a personal stealth ability instead of radar jamming.</li>

                <p>
                  The novax satellite has been given a decent speed buff and more intel based capabilities. That way a single novax satellite won't be quite as bad as it currently is since it provides some intel where you might have none otherwise.
                  <br>The cost increase for rebuilding the satellite - which can only be shot down by a strategic missile at the moment - will make nerf it as a tool to lock the t4 nuke launcher.

                <p>The seraphim t1 arty is currently a very strong tool vs navy. The speed on water nerf - which has been done to other hover units before already - will make the life of the average aeon navy player a bit easier.</p>

                T2 and T3 Mass Fabricators have been rebalanced to make T2 Fabs slightly less efficient and T3 a lot more efficient than before. <br><br>
                T2 Fab

                  <li>The adjacency bonus for buildings has been buffed to 20% which is the same value as the one we currently have for buildings of the size of a factory. Gateways are an exception. They get a 3.75% bonus which is similar to what you get for ringing the Gateway with T2 Fabricators.</li>
